**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/571/view) Points
###Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

---
###Writeup / README

####1. Provide a Writeup / README that includes all the rubric points and how you addressed each one.  You can submit your writeup as markdown or pdf.  [Here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) is a template writeup for this project you can use as a guide and a starting point.  

You're reading it!
###Camera Calibration

####1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

The code for this step is contained in the second code cell of the IPython notebook located in "./Lines Finder.ipynb".  

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result: 

Check calibration using chessboard image:

###Pipeline (single images)

####1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.
To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text][calibration_test_1]

####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.
Before reaching final pipeline for images preprocessing several experiments were taken to find the best results:

Gradients:
![alt text][gradients_0] 

As it is seen best result here were seen on Thresholded Gradient X image.

On the next step I decided to combine previous results using rule:
```
    combined[((grad_x_binary == 1) & (grad_y_binary == 1)) & ((mag_binary == 1) | (dir_binary == 1))] = 1
```
That results to:

![alt text][combined_0]

But as it is seen left yellow line was almost lost in this configuration. 

To restore yellow line I decided to take a look on S chanel after converting image to HLS colorspace:
 
![alt text][hls_chanels]


Combining thresholds for S chanel and results for previous thresholds processing I got the next frame: 
```
    combined_binary[(binary_s == 1) | (combined == 1)] = 1
```

![alt text][pipeline_result]

This result will be used later to find land lanes.

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `perspective()`  in my IPython notebook.  The `perspective()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`).  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```
src = np.float32([[240, 686], 
                  [1070, 686], 
                  [738, 480], 
                  [545,  480]])
                      
dst = np.float32([[300, 700], 
                  [1000, 700], 
                  [1000, 300], 
                  [300, 300]])

```

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src`  points onto a test image to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image I plot them.

####4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Input for this step was taken as a combined image after preprocessing pipeline and converted  to 'bird-eye' view using perspective transformation:

Then calculating a histogram and find out its peaks I found where lines are located. These points are treated as a starting ponits for lines detection algorithm.
On the next step image was separated by 9 windows and moving from the bottom to the top for each line. In each line was selected pixels that are not zero.
Each next window was recentered using mean position of non 0 pixels detected in previous step.

After pixels were detected polyfit function was used to find —Åoefficients for  second order polynomial.
```
# Fit a second order polynomial to each
line.current_fit = np.polyfit(line.ally, line.allx, 2)
```

Resulting polinomial can be seen on the following image drawn with yellow and cyan colors.

![alt text][detect_lines]

More detailed steps can be found in `find_curved_lines()` function in my notebook. 

####5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

Using this [algorithm](http://www.intmath.com/applications-differentiation/8-radius-curvature.php) I calculated the radius of curvature of both detected lanes:

I did this in `__calculate_radius_of_curvature()` and `__calculate_offest_from_center()` methods in cell 16 of my notebook.

####6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.
Here are more examples of detected lines.

###Pipeline (video)

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output.mp4) and [Youtube version](https://youtu.be/fnuYv5vgWpo).

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?
Approach taken in this project allows to detect lines more accurate then it was taken in [project 1](https://github.com/denismoroz/carnd-p1-lanelines) that is based only on Canny edges.

Main issues for me raised when I tried to find right source points for perspective transformation. 
Changing source coordinate in couple of pixels were leads to wrong values for radius.

As it is seen pictures for birds view, not all noise is removed by processing line, so additional investigation should be taken to make it more robust.
